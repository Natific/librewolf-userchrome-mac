# librewolf-userchrome-mac
my userchrome config for librewolf

to install replace the userchrome.css file in your chrome folder in your firefox profile (found in: about:profiles)

combined with black7375's Firefox UI Fix with the Photon preset: https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix

firefox theme I used: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/beautiful-opera-gx-fucsia/

add ons I use:
- Content Blockers
  - uBlock Origin - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/
    - The best overall ad, content, and tracker blocker (if on Librewolf it comes pre-installed)
  - i still don't care about cookies - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/
    - Fork of i don't care about cookies (acquired by avast), automatically hide the cookie warning everytime a website is opened
  - Privacy Badger - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/
    -  A second net for uBlock that learns overtime to block trackers that uBlock misses (will often screw up google login so disable it if you can't login to google)
  - Local CDN - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/
    - Fork of decentraleyes which protects you from CDN tracking by injecting and upgrading the connections with local resources
  - Canvas Blocker - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/
    - Blocks HTML Canvas tracking by injecting fake results
  - Clear URLs - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/reviews/
    - removes most tracking elements from websites that embed trackers into URLs
  - Don't track me Google - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/
    - removes the annoying link conversion that google does to track you
- Visual Changes
  - Tree Style Tabs - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/
    - The vertical tabs shown in my screenshot that shows tabs in a tree, very useful for doing research 
  - Language Tool - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/languagetool/
    -  Grammarly but with a bit more free freatures including multiple language support
  - Better Canvas (for school) - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-canvas/
    - Adds a few minor changes to the Canvas platform by Instructure
